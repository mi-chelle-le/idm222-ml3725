        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Through these animated drawings, I illustrated the feelings of high school students as they were spending crucial years of their adolescence quarantined inside. This was a project I did in my senior year of high school. All illustrations and layers were draw in Procreate and brought into Adobe After Effects to animate.</p>

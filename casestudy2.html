        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Cat Run is an infinite runner game, similar to Temple Run or Subway Surfers. Working on a team with a programmer and 3D modeler, we brainstormed the gameplay, designed the mechanics, created the player model and environment, and programmed it all together in Unity. I was specifically tasked with designing the UI for the game and helping with brainstorming the mechanics of the gameplay.</p>

        <h3>What's the Game About</h3>
        <p>Everyone loves a classic infinite runner game, and what's better than cute cats running on the screen? The aim of Cat Run is simple: dodge all the oncoming cat paws by jumping and moving left or right. However, it's not as simple once the speed increases the longer you survive. Test your skills to see how high of a score you can achieve! Although a single-player game, you can encourage competition by challenging your friends to see who makes it the furthest.</p>

        <h3>Playtesting</h3>
        <p>When playtesting, we allowed participants to play our game without any explanation as to what it did or what the controls were. Majority of people picked up on the controls immediately. A couple people were confused as to which controls moved the plater. One participant was unaware that jumping was a mechanic in the game. To address this, I implemented a controls panel that visually shows which keys control the player.</p>
